# ocrd_calamari

Recognize text using [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari).

Introduction
-------------

This offers a OCR-D compliant workspace processor for some of the functionality of Calamari OCR.

This processor only operates on the text line level and so needs a line segmentation (and by extension a binarized 
image) as its input.
